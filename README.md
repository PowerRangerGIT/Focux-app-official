# Focux-app-official
a focus app for ADD and ADHD persons

This app was created to help me stop procrastinating, and I hope it helps you too.

The goal of the app is to help you be more productive and maintain a smooth and comfortable workspace, using scientifically proven methods to combat procrastination and increase concentration in neurodivergent people, such as:
Pomodoro timer
Visible to-do lists
Immersive white and brown noises

More features coming soon...

If the app helped you, share it with your friends and acquaintances, so we can help more people.
